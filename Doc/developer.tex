    \item ``Remote attempted to call a RPC that does not exist (maybe a name typo in the source code?)''\\
        This essentially just means that an unregistered RPC was called. Unfortunately it does not give
        the name of the procedure. Usually this is fixed by importing the relevant file that contains the
        RPC definition, fixing a typo, or implementing a non-existing RPC.
