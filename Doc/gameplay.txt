This document describes all major gameplay philosophies. It's not an end-to-end description of
everything about the game.

======================WORLD======================
It will be unreasonable to create a massive world. What seems much more feasible is creating a
relatively small world with high replayability. Runs of the game should be beatable in
a handful of hours.

The world itself can help improve replayability. No ideas here are final, but this is my best estimation
at replayability:
- Randomly generated terrain may help give each run of the game a unique feel. But the world will need
to be interesting whether there's random generation or not.
- Randomly chosen enemies can help create variance in player's choices. If enemies are sufficiently
different from one another, then the player will need to use different strategies. If enemies drop
different things, then the player will need to make different choices about their character build.
Both of these features are improved if there's room for the player to predict the kinds of enemies
he/she faces.
- Reduce unique names, or if using unique names, procedurally generate the names. This includes zone
names, so rather than have named zones, maybe use biomes.

Tentative plan for biomes:
- There will be a handful (5?) different biomes that the player will have to clear to complete the game.
- Each biome will have different types of enemies: common, elite, and one boss.
- Common enemies respawn, elites and bosses respawn as common enemies. This will usher the players to
progress through the world, rather than just repeat encounters and become OP.
- Killing the boss unlocks the next zone. You can't go back once you enter a new zone.
- In multiplayer, all players must stay in the same zone.
- There are different factions (3 per zone), boss defined by main faction and most of the rest
of enemies follow the main faction, but straggler commons and elites can be different factions.
Prevalence of each faction is randomly chosen on each run.
Per faction, the number of different types of enemies are:
1 boss
3 elites
5 common enemies

Some biome/faction ideas:
Forest - Cultists, Treants, Dark Elves
Desert - Undead, Scarabs, Raiders
Island - Pirates, Merfolk, Crabs (might be complex and definitely contingent on a water implementation)
Jungle - Apes, Crocodilian people, Spiders
Tundra - Vikings, Bears, Yetis
Swamp - Frog people, Goblins, Fungus people
Volcanic Expanse - Demons, Dragons, Fire Elementals/Golems

Quests will be present in the world, but small. There will be a handful of friendly NPCs which 
will ask for a particular item and give some worthwhile reward. Would be best to make the location/items
of NPCs random.


=======================COMBAT=======================
Central objects of combat:
Auto attacks:
- Attacks are attempts to hit your target with your weapon, which can be melee or ranged.
- You can toggle whether or not you are auto attacking, and they will be performed automatically.
- You can dual wield two one-handed weapons. In this case, they operate on separate timers, and your offhand
rate depends on your dual wield skill level.
Powers:
- Powers are spells and abilities you cast/use to apply an effect to an enemy.
- Powers are located on the action bar at the bottom of the screen.
- Powers incur a global cooldown which prevents the character from performing any actions (attacks or powers).
- Powers also have individual cooldowns, in addition to the global cooldown incursion.
- There are lots of different types of distinctions of powers/spells:
- Enchantments are beneficial spells, curses are harmful spells.
- Instant powers have a single effect that is applied and not put into memory, ie damage or healing.
- Persistent powers provide a lasting effect, either buffs or debuffs.
- Channeled powers have a cast/use time, and apply effects over time (and/or at the end).
NPCs:
- NPCs will have access to auto attacks, powers, and special attacks.
- NPCs will drop a scroll for each power they have access to, allowing players to learn it.
Will likely be consumed upon learning.
- Special attacks are basically just powers, but specific to particular NPCs and not dropped as scrolls.
- In combat, the NPC AI will perform actions on a timer-based system. The timer will not be fixed,
instead it will depend on the action. Auto attacking will probably be constant (but depend on the NPC
and their weapon), powers and special attacks will just use the GCD or use time of it.

Balance constraints:
- Health should feel like a finite resource.
- Minimize number of meaningless durations (like buffs in Everquest)
- Player should have multiple choices in combat encounters

Power ideas:
Melee:
- Stances; offensive and defensive.
Ranged:
- Elemental arrows (probably implement as a buff that lasts for a single shot, zero gcd)
- Arrow rain (works with elemental arrows)
- Headshot (low accuracy but high damage attack)
Magic:
- DoT's that spread to other enemies
- DoT's that end in an explosion
Healing:
- Heals over time.
Support:
- High-damage thorns that only last a few seconds.
- Curses that cause the target's next spell to misfire. This will need a long cooldown.
- Curse that puts some of the target's powers on cooldown.
- Charm - turn an enemy friendly temporarily
- Generic debuffs to increase damage or weaken enemy
- Sacrifice health to restore energy to allies
- Animal forms
- Purification spells that remove debuffs

Elemental system:
Speculating how to implement an elemental system (in the future), if at all.
Main considerations of an elemental system:
- Adds new dimensions to combat.
- Might increase player choice. Or not?
- If the elemental system is a huge part of combat (like, dictates 50% of damage), then encounters
range from being impossible without the correct elements, to being trivial with the correct elements.
- Lots of things to keep track of/potentially items to store just in case you need them for an elemental
npc.

I think that elements should play a modest role in combat, and shouldn't dictate too much of the
damage calculation.
What's certain is that different types (fire, ice, poison, etc) will have different identities.
Fire spells will always be fast DoT's (maybe like 20 small hits in 5 seconds), poisons will be slower
DoT's, etc.
The next question is whether there should be explicit stats that influence these types, or whether 
to make it more subtle. For example, characters which are good at tanking lots of small hits would
be naturally better at resisting fire attacks. Is it necessary, then, to have a fire resist which reduces
damage?
One thing to keep in mind is proportionality. Ideally, there are not too many stats (hoping for 10-15 if
possible), and if each element has its own resist stat, that would take up a lot of stats.
A good middle ground might be to have a single stat like "Hardiness" which reduces the effects of all
elements on the character. This way, the player still has the same level of choice, but doesn't have to
juggle a bunch of different gear for specific encounters and have their stats screen flooded.
Might not be maximally flavorful, but should be good enough.



==============DEATH=================
The ideal system is hard-permadeath for single player, and soft-permadeath for multiplayer.
Soft-permadeath meaning that allies can get revived somehow, but if the whole party dies, the
world is lost.

An idea for soft-permadeath in multiplayer is having bosses drop revive stones. Can also provide
resurrection spells.

Might be nice to decouple character deaths and world deaths, and allow for players to play a character
even after death. This would necessitate multiple difficulties of the game, I think. Basically, you can
play the same character and die as much as you want, but you have to restart the world (and the world
will be different). Once you beat the world on one difficulty, you can move on to the next, and so on.


=================STATS================
These are quantities assigned to the character that influence respective in-game interactions.
Current idea of stats is very basic, not clear what it will look like at the moment.


=================SKILLS=================
These tell how proficient a character is at certain tasks, such as attacking with 1-handed melee weapons
or dodging attacks.
Similar to stats, the actual skills will be refined as combat gets implemented.


==================ITEMS====================
Main planned item types right now are equipments and scrolls. Scrolls are unlockable powers dropped
by NPCs with access to those powers.
There are very few equipment slots. There are a lot of favorable things about this decision:
- Reduced development time (I don't need to make as many items)
- Individual gear upgrades feel more impactful
- Players don't need to spend as much time farming gear or being behind on some slots

It *might* be cool to have a random enchanting system like in MoM for all equipment (not just common ones).
Except they'd actually be good. I'm reluctant to do this because it would be hard to balance, especially
to balance stronger weapons (such as those dropped by bosses). Might also be less flavorful.
If I also choose to make an elemental system a core part of combat, these should definitely be
intertwined.
