# Repository for the game Troop of Olde

# Pre-push checklist:
Check all of these things if your change could have possibly affected this functionality. Ideally these will
be integration tested at some point.
- Can open the game in both online mode and offline mode
- Can move around and jump
- Can move items within inventory, and equipping changes stats
- Can attack and kill an npc, and skills rise from doing this
