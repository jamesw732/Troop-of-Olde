This file contains a heap-like todo list, with the following priorities:
Right now - These are things that I'm actively doing whenever I spend time developing
Next - These are things that I need to do next, after I'm finished with what I'm doing right now
Backlog - These are things that could be done, but are not high priority
Distant - These are abstract ideas about things that will need to be done eventually


Right now:
First, just try to get the code working while also working towards a cleaner division between server code
and client code. Ideally, there are no more "if network.peer.is_hosting()" lines.


Check that logging out works as expected

Characters:
Probably would be good to have some cases when equipping equipment upon character creation. Should be
able to equip items without changing stats.


Next:
- Rework combat code structure, some of it can definitely go into Character
- Clean up states, networking/state_updates.py can be moved to networking/world_requests.py
- Improve networking containers. Two main changes here, one is changing the internal equipment and
inventory containers to just be lists. It may be valid to keep a slot_to_ind
dictionary so that the naming is clear for the equipment, but sending dictionaries instead of lists over
the network just feels extremely cumbersome.
The other is to unify "page1" and "page2" of the lexicon... this can and should really just be a list.
In both cases, I'll need to encode an "empty" element, probably just as the empty string.
- Remove is_hosting check from item init


Rework task documentation/ideas. For now, I think the following files will suffice:
- A todo list (this one)
- A tex document which basically documents EVERYTHING - code architecture, formulas used/implementation
    details, philosophy (monetization, development practices, what makes a game fun), game mechanics/features,
    lore, class content, documentation plan.
This file essentially serves as the implementation definition.
- Stuff like technical_debt, performance_improvements should get moved to github issues. Basically, anything
more distant than "Backlog" and more specific than "Distant" belongs in a Github issue.





Backlog:
Work on ironing out the current functionality of the code.
This includes:
Refining combat formulas to incorporate skills and anything left behind (some of this may be done):
- attack range (done)
- damage (done ish)
- accuracy (needs skills)
- probability to upgrade skill
- dual wield attack rate
- 2h weapons
Fix bars window not updating stamina and mana
Fill out the weapon types, create new weapons
Make item movement smoother - maybe if mouse velocity is high or has moved sufficiently, start dragging the item
immediately rather than waiting


Clean up the code, including some things from technical_debt:
- Inconsistencies in the UI code
- Order of functions in some files could be improved
- Remove * imports, replace with full module imports


Flesh out Effects, spells, abilities



Distant/Big Picture:
- Combat system (effects, spells, abilities, npc logic) - Python/Ursina
- Databasing for mobs, items, etc - json at first, then sqlite/sqlalchemy
- GUI - Ursina
- Character models - Blender (AI?)
- Character textures - Blender (AI?)
- World terrain - Perlin noise (+ Panda3D or maybe handwritten)
- World structures - Blender (AI?)
- World textures - Blender builtin https://cloud.blender.org/p/textures/5813449c1f474213fb4babc5
