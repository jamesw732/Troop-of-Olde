This file contains a heap-like todo list, with the following priorities:

ACTIVE:
This is whatever I'm spending active development time on. Should only really have one thing here.

NEXT:
These are basically "next steps" in whatever overarching task I'm working on.
Things that are put here should not stay on here very long, either pushed into "ACTIVE" once
I decide it's time to work on it, or pushed back to "BACKLOG" when I realize I'm farther away than
I thought.

BACKLOG:
These are specific tasks that I'm not very close to accomplishing. Tasks on here might need to get
split up substantially before being approachable, and might require more thought before I know how they work.
Tasks in here get popped into "NEXT" or "RIGHT NOW" once I am ready to start implementing them.
This section will get pretty vast, so some organization is helpful.

DISTANT:
These are abstract ideas about things that will need to be done eventually, but I haven't thought about.
Generally, these are huge tasks that I need to seriously split up to be able to parse.


===========================ACTIVE===============================
Current bugs:
Clipping through surfaces (specifically slopes).


===================================NEXT================================================
Add individual cooldowns for powers, and animations for cooldowns/gcd

Add more types of powers.
Want one of each of the following:
Instant enchantment (a heal spell),
Persistent enchantment (a buff),
Persistent curse (a debuff)
Channeled enchantment (a channeled heal)
Channeled curse (a channeled damage spell)


Start adding some character assets and animations. Huge project.

=========================================BACKLOG=================================================
Combat/Character:
Neglected formulas:
- probability to upgrade skill
- hit chance/accuracy
- dual wield attack rate

Incomplete subcontent:
- Weapon types
- Effects/powers, not nearly enough types at the moment.

Incomplete stat implementations:
- Energy
- Armor
- All the modifiers
- Regeneration
- Hardiness


UI:
UI is quite incomplete, there is a lot of helpful information that should be tracked by the UI.
Off the top of my head:
- player's target
- in combat/not
- persistent effects (future)
- Enemy drops (future)

Current UI functionality is also quite lacking.
- Hover and right click tooltips, which will be the primary visual guide for the UI
- Allow swapping of action bar slots
- Allow destroying items

There are some bugs as well:
- Transparency handling for the game window is buggy since the scrollbar has its own collider. Basically,
the current handling for mouse enter/exit is fragile - entering on and exiting from a child entity
with a collider doesn't correctly trigger the transparency change. Unclear how to fix this, worst case
can remove the collider.
- There's also a bug with new text entering the game window with the wrong transparency. I think text should
probably be ignored by set_alpha altogether.


Database:
Move to sql


Documentation:
Ideally, I want some big tex files that document everything important, such as code architecture, formulas used,
philosophy, game mechanics, class content. These files essentially serves as the implementation definition.

Also, should eventually move things onto Github issues once the repository is more stable.


Tests:
Tests currently are very broken and limited in functionality. Codebase is too volatile to sustain tests
at the moment, once things are more stable it will be a good idea to test things.
Could also consider test-driven development, where I should understand the interface of the code before
writing the code.
