Implementation todo list.

===========================ACTIVE===============================
Have basic model, try to get basic animations for everything in the game.
This will be placeholder for a pretty good while.

I think the easiest approach will be to use Panda3D's Actor class.
Unfortunately, this means reconciling PhysicalState to be able to handle actors OR
models. Models will probably only ever be used when they're cubes, but should still
keep their functionality.

To avoid future confusion about what a PhysicalState actually is, I should confine their
use case to character creation only. They encode everything physical about a Character
necessary to create it, but afterwards, the client/server should use the raw attrs or
a different State class.
Should remove PhysicalState from update_lerp_state, and also remove cname as an attr of
PhysicalState.


===================================NEXT================================================
Move to a database instead of using json.

=========================================BACKLOG=================================================
Generic Code cleanup:
- Replace some "if" checks and "get"s with try/except blocks. I rely too hard on crash errors,
- I should instead leverage warnings that don't break the game.
- Consider changing usage of States in the code. Maybe remove cname from PhysicalState
I wonder if I should just have a State called "LoginState"? Might cause issues with size, but it
would be a lot more clear what's actually going on.
Should, at the very least, make "State" a more well-defined class.


Physics:
Implement momentum, make it be a list of the 5 most recent keyboard movement vectors. They are
averaged and added as a displacement factor if no keyboard inputs for that physics tick.
Add more raycasts for collision logic.
Use a loop for raycasts to not collide through concave intersections
Improve wall collision logic, namely removing ability to jump up walls.
Jumping is sometimes very buggy, but sometimes fine?


Combat:
Neglected formulas:
- probability to upgrade skill
- hit chance/accuracy
- dual wield attack rate

Incomplete subcontent:
- Weapon types
- Effects/powers, not nearly enough types at the moment.

Incomplete stat implementations:
- Energy
- Armor
- All the modifiers
- Regeneration
- Hardiness


Character:
Stats object should probably have a more elegant interaction with Characters. Would
be nice to unify Stats with all the different Effect types.


Powers:
Add a channeled power.
Need to add client-side reconciliation for powers
Add a UI window showing persistent powers
Make persistent powers unique per character
Improve powers/effects database, will need to think about this a lot


UI:
UI is quite incomplete, there is a lot of helpful information that should be tracked by the UI:
- player's target's health
- in combat/not
- persistent effects

Some missing functionality:
- Loot window
- Hover and right click tooltips, which will be the primary visual guide for the UI
- Swapping of action bar slots
- Destroying items

There are some bugs as well:
- Scrolling with mousewheel while scrollbar is full results in division by zero
- Transparency handling for the game window is buggy since the scrollbar has its own collider.
Basically, the current handling for mouse enter/exit is fragile - entering on and exiting from a
child entity with a collider doesn't correctly trigger the transparency change. Unclear how to fix
this, worst case can remove the collider.
- There's also a bug with new text entering the game window with the wrong transparency. I think
text should probably be ignored by set_alpha altogether.


Database:
Move to sql


Documentation:
Ideally, I want some big tex files that document everything important, such as code architecture,
formulas used, philosophy, game mechanics, class content. These files essentially serves as the
implementation definition.

Also, should eventually move things onto Github issues once the repository is more stable.


Tests:
Tests currently are very broken and limited in functionality. Codebase is too volatile to sustain tests
at the moment, once things are more stable it will be a good idea to test things.
Could also consider test-driven development, where I should understand the interface of the code before
writing the code.
