This file contains a heap-like todo list, with the following priorities:
Right now - These are things that I'm actively doing whenever I spend time developing
Next - These are things that I need to do next, after I'm finished with what I'm doing right now
Backlog - These are things that could be done, but are not high priority
Distant - These are abstract ideas about things that will need to be done eventually


Right now:
Clean up the code to a passable level. Remove all smells, and fix any buggy behavior.

- Make Power not depend on char
- Improve networking containers. Several changes here:
1. Consider changing the internal equipment and inventory containers to just be lists.
It may be valid to keep a slot_to_ind dictionary so that the naming is clear for the equipment,
but sending dictionaries instead of lists over the network just feels extremely cumbersome. On the other
hand, it seems cumbersome to store the whole equipment/inventory states in the json.
Will require encoding an "empty" element both in the json and in runtime, probably empty string.
2. Unify "page1" and "page2" of the lexicon... this can just be one IdContainer. Eventually need to
move towards having multiple pages, but this can stay off the table for now.

- Figure out the kinks in the physics system, such as not being able to jump twice in a row or
shooting up the wall.
- Send stat updates before player opens stat window, updating only after the player opens seems bad.


Next:
Rework task documentation/ideas. For now, I think the following files will suffice:
- A todo list (this one)
- A tex document which basically documents EVERYTHING - code architecture, formulas used/implementation
    details, philosophy (monetization, development practices, what makes a game fun), game mechanics/features,
    lore, class content, documentation plan.
This file essentially serves as the implementation definition.
- Stuff like technical_debt, performance_improvements should get moved to github issues. Basically, anything
more distant than "Backlog" and more specific than "Distant" belongs in a Github issue.

Test everything.



Backlog:
Work on ironing out the current functionality of the code.
This includes:
Refining combat formulas to incorporate skills and anything left behind (some of this may be done):
- attack range (done)
- damage (done ish)
- accuracy (needs skills)
- probability to upgrade skill
- dual wield attack rate
- 2h weapons
Fix bars window not updating stamina and mana
Fill out the weapon types, create new weapons
Make item movement smoother - maybe if mouse velocity is high or has moved sufficiently, start dragging the item
immediately rather than waiting


Clean up the code, including some things from technical_debt:
- Inconsistencies in the UI code
- Order of functions in some files could be improved
- Remove * imports, replace with full module imports


Flesh out Effects, spells, abilities



Distant/Big Picture:
- Combat system (effects, spells, abilities, npc logic) - Python/Ursina
- Databasing for mobs, items, etc - json at first, then sqlite/sqlalchemy
- GUI - Ursina
- Character models - Blender (AI?)
- Character textures - Blender (AI?)
- World terrain - Perlin noise (+ Panda3D or maybe handwritten)
- World structures - Blender (AI?)
- World textures - Blender builtin https://cloud.blender.org/p/textures/5813449c1f474213fb4babc5
